# Prometheus Discourse

**Project description:** Each year Prometheus (the fire spinning club I'm in) has an event called Discourse. This year the topic was "casseroles," and people were encouraged to argue about what casseroles are based on whether or not a particular dish or item was a casserole. I've created a few plots to practice using plotly to create interactive graphs.


This last Saturday was Prometheus's annual Discourse. Each year the members of Prometheus get together to debate about food, and this semester the debate was about what a casserole is. As the discourse master, I decided to do something fun this year to celebrate the first proper discourse since my Freshman year. I used Bayesian Linear Regression using INLA to attempt to estimate the underlying distribution of voting scores for each casserole.


In Exploratory Data Analysis last week we used a package based on plotly to look at market basket analysis. I thought the interactive graphs were cool, so I decided to try playing around with plotly. The graphs I made are a little messy because I made them in less than 24 hours, but I think they're an interesting first attempt at using plotly.
